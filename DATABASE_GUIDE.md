## üéÆ Usage

### Command Line Interface

```bash
# Start interactive query interface
npm run query-db

# Or use sqlite3 directly
sqlite3 dopewars_data.db
```

### Predefined Queries

The query interface includes 12 predefined queries:

1. **All Drugs** - List all drugs with prices
2. **Cheap Drugs Only** - Drugs that can have cheap events
3. **Expensive Drugs Only** - Drugs that can have expensive events
4. **All Locations** - Locations ordered by police presence
5. **All Guns** - Guns ordered by price
6. **All Cops** - Cop types ordered by armor
7. **Drug Prices Day 1 (Manhattan)** - Manhattan prices on day 1
8. **Drug Prices Day 1 (Bronx)** - Bronx prices on day 1 (cheaper)
9. **Drug Availability by Location** - Which drugs are available where
10. **Price Comparison** - Manhattan vs Bronx price differences
11. **Most Profitable Drugs** - Best profit margins in Manhattan
12. **Database Statistics** - Overview of all data

### Example Queries

#### Find cheapest drugs in Bronx on day 1:
```sql
SELECT d.name, dp.price 
FROM drug_prices dp 
JOIN drugs d ON dp.drug_id = d.id 
JOIN locations l ON dp.location_id = l.id 
WHERE dp.day = 1 AND l.name = 'Bronx' 
ORDER BY dp.price 
LIMIT 5;
```

#### Compare prices between locations:
```sql
SELECT d.name as drug,
       m.price as manhattan_price,
       b.price as bronx_price,
       (m.price - b.price) as savings
FROM drugs d
JOIN drug_prices m ON d.id = m.drug_id
JOIN locations lm ON m.location_id = lm.id
JOIN drug_prices b ON d.id = b.drug_id
JOIN locations lb ON b.location_id = lb.id
WHERE m.day = 1 AND b.day = 1
AND lm.name = 'Manhattan' AND lb.name = 'Bronx'
ORDER BY savings DESC;
```

#### Find most profitable drugs:
```sql
SELECT d.name as drug,
       dp.price,
       (dp.price - d.min_price) as potential_profit
FROM drug_prices dp
JOIN drugs d ON dp.drug_id = d.id
JOIN locations l ON dp.location_id = l.id
WHERE dp.day = 1 AND l.name = 'Manhattan'
ORDER BY potential_profit DESC;
```

## üìà Key Insights

### Price Patterns
- **Bronx & Ghetto**: 30% cheaper than other locations
- **Manhattan**: Highest prices, lowest police presence (90)
- **Cheap drugs**: Acid, Hashish, Ludes, Weed (can be √∑4 price)
